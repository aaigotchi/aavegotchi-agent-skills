# Aavegotchi Agent Skills

A curated index of open-source **AI agent skills** for the **Aavegotchi** ecosystem and the broader **NFT / crypto / Web3** stack.

Use this repo if you're building an LLM-powered agent (Codex, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) that needs Aavegotchi-specific tools and workflows like:

- NFT marketplace search and analytics (Aavegotchi Baazaar)
- GBM auctions (bidding, monitoring, strategy tooling)
- Kinship automation and "auto-pet" bots (Base)
- Onchain interactions and automation for Aavegotchi + DeFi-adjacent flows
